## :book: Overview

The `covid19` package provides an overview of the COVID-19 epidemic with built-in Shiny app `COVID-19 Global Cases`, which can help the user to get some insights about the development of COVID-19 quickly. Also, some built-in functions may allow you to make some changes for the built-in Shiny app. You can learn more about them in [vignette](https://etc5523-2020.github.io/r-package-assessment-cuiping-wei/).

```

`covid19` package has the following functions:  

* `launch_app()` to launch built-in Shiny app.  
* `ui_page()` to create a shiny dashboard page for using in Shiny app.  
* `valuebox()` to output Shiny valueBox.
* `input_type()` to create a input module for Shiny app.  
* `plot_highchart()` to create a interactive highchart plot.

## :star2: Example

There are some basic examples which show you how to explore `covid19` package:

#### Population data

```{r pop, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(covid19)
library(magrittr)
pop_data %>% 
  head(5)
```


#### Launch Shiny app
```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## launch Shiny app
library(covid19)
launch_app()
```


#### Creating highchart plot
```{r highchart, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## create a highchart plot
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(coronavirus)
library(covid19)

data("coronavirus")
data <- coronavirus %>%
        filter(date >= '2020-10-10' & date <= '2020-10-16') %>%
        filter(country %in% c("Afghanistan", "Liberia", "Austria")) %>%
        filter(type == "confirmed")

plot_highchart(df = data, x = date, y = cases, group = country, ylabs = 'Confirmed cases',
               xlabs = 'Date', title = 'COVID-19 confirmed cases')
```
