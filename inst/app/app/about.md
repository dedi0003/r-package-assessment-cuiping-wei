### COVID-19 Global Cases

This shiny web app provides an overview of the COVID-19 epidemic, which is built with R using the markdown and shiny.  
  
### Data source

The incidence data used for this web app is obtained from R package [coronavirus](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) provided by RamiKrispin, which contains global COVID-19 data, and the raw data collected and arranged by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering [(JHU CCSE)](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus-csv). 


### Motivation

With COVID-19 outbreaks occurring worldwide, it would be meaningful to create a web app that displays global COVID-19 data, giving us a clearer picture of the epidemic around the world. Meanwhile, we can choose different countries to compare them with varying charts within this shiny web app, which can help us explore the differences between countries. It was also a challenging thing for me to make this web app, and it also helped me improve my skills.
