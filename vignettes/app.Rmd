## What it does?

This Shiny web app is mainly for updating real-time data of COVID-19, simple visualization and comparison of different countries with graphs and table, rather than comprehensive analyses or model prediction. Next, I'm going to give you a brief overview of what this app does.  

- **Update data**

To obtain the latest data, you can use `update_dataset()` function.  

- **Global COVID-19 overview**

You can find a brief statistical overview for cases on this app.

If you want to see how COVID-19 cases have changed in countries around the world since the outbreak began or over a certain period, you can use Date Slider to select a date range and show the animation on a map. Also, you can choose the variables you want to explore, such as confirmed, death, recovered and active.
